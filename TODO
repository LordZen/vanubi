= BUGS
* Improve indentation support for vala and c

  Pressing HOME twice will move the cursor to column 0.

= IDEAS
* KEYS: Simple, complete, keyboard based, intelligent, unobtrusive, well integrated
* KEYS: Implement what you really use, not what you don't use
* KEYS: Implement what you expect, not what other editors do
* KEYS: Implement what you really need, not what you think you need
* File/directory-based settings, not project-based
* Intelligent defaults based on the current opened file context
* Easy to use contextual help... we can't remember all the keybindings
* Semantic support for languages similar to eclipse but much less invasive

== TOOLS

* GDB
* Hexdump
